								<h1>Disneyland Sentiment Analysis</h1>
							</header>
						<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
						<p style="font-family:helvetica">
							This project centers around the concept of sentiment analysis visualization of a Disneyland
							review dataset using WordClouds. By utilizing SQL queries, Tableau visualizations,
							and Python, the data is analyzed to identify customer satisfaction trends and create a
							visualization of words most commonly appearing in positive and negative reviews.
						</p>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p style="font-family:helvetica">
							Scouring the endless supply of Kaggle datasets, I stumbled across
							<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews?resource=download">this</a>
							dataset which contained data totalling ~42,000 reviews from Trip Advisor for three Disneyland locations:
							Paris, California, and Hong Kong. The dataset looked interesting enough, but what really interested
							me was what insights I could pull from the review text and see if I could identify problem points
							at each location.
						</p>
						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<p style="font-family:helvetica">
							The first step in analyzing the data was finding the average rating by location as well as
							how they changed with respect to time.
						</p >
							<h4>Query 1: Return average rating and total ratings by park location</h4>
							<pre><code>SELECT Branch,AVG(Rating) as Avg_Rating, COUNT(Review_ID) as Num_Reviews
FROM `test-project-357201.disney_project.disney_data`
GROUP BY Branch
</code></pre>

							<h4>Query 2: Group ratings by park and month</h4>
							<pre><code>SELECT Branch, Year_Month, AVG(Rating) as Avg_Rating, COUNT(Review_ID) as Num_Reviews
FROM `test-project-357201.disney_project.disney_data`
WHERE Year_Month != "missing"
GROUP BY Year_Month, Branch
ORDER BY Year_Month DESC, Branch
LIMIT 1000
</code></pre>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="project_pages/project_images/project_1/tableau_disney_rating_vs_time.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p style="font-family:helvetica">
								Using the results from Query 2, the rating for each park over
								time (seen above) was created using Tableau. From inspection, it's observed
								that the California location received the highest reviews for nearly 9 years (averaging
								a rating of 4.4), while Paris received the worst ratings (averaging a rating of 3.9).
								<br/><br/>
								Before continuing into analyzing the review text, it's important to understand the
								breakdown of park visitor origins to provide further context to the analysis. Using Query 3,
								data for all the reviewer locations for each park are retrieved which are then visualized
								using Tableau.
							</p>

							<h4>Query 3: Reviewer location by park location</h4>
							<pre><code>SELECT Reviewer_Location,COUNT(Review_ID) as Num_Visitors
FROM `test-project-357201.disney_project.disney_data`
WHERE Branch = "Disneyland_[Branch]"
GROUP BY Reviewer_Location
LIMIT 1000

							<p style="font-family:helvetica">
								Based on data, the bulk of reviews come from the United States and United Kingdom.
								While the visualizations help show where the reviews are coming from, it's important to
								note that this data is not representative of the parks actual visitors. Since the data
								is collected from Trip Advisor, there is bias for countries that primarily use
								the website for travel reviews. This is likely why Hong Kong doesn't appear in even
								the top five reviewer locations for Disneyland Hong Kong.
							</p>
							<p style="font-family:helvetica">
								To conduct the sentiment analysis, a SQL query is used to extract the dataset for
								one-star reviews from each location and is then fed into a Python script to read,
								analyze, and create the WordCloud diagram. In order to identify problem areas, words
								that relate to the park name itself or long lines were ignored as they both frequently
								appear reviews, regardless of rating.
							</p>
							<h4>Query 4: Extract one-star ratings filtering for each park</h4>
							<pre><code>SELECT Review_ID,Review_Text
FROM `test-project-357201.disney_project.disney_data`
WHERE Branch = "Disneyland_[Branch]", Rating = 1
LIMIT 1000</code></pre>
							<h4>Python 1: Script to create WordClouds from CSV data</h4>
							<pre><code>import pandas as pd

							<p style="font-family:helvetica">
								The three WordClouds share many of the same commonly occurring words, but one point that
								stands out is that "staff" and "food" are starkly more recurring in the Paris and Hong Kong
								reviews compared to the California reviews.

								While inspecting the data, another point that stood out was that "closed" appeared more
								commonly in the Paris reviews compared to the other parks. After further research, renovations
								and maintenance have caused various ride closures throughout the years.
							</p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p style="font-family:helvetica">
								WordClouds proved to be an effective method in visualizing review data. By controlling
								for stop words, areas needing improvement such as staff, food, and ride closures become
								more clear. While results seem promising, the data may be skewed in favor of English-speaking
								reviewers which would lead to an unrepresentative model especially of the Hong Kong branch
								as seen in the reviewer location breakdowns.
